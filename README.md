# Problem Solving App

This is my long term backburner project. The immediate goal is to provide a new intuitive way for students from the level of advancd high school through undergraduate college to solve physics problems that have an answer consisting of a number with a unit.

This app will allow complex problem solving to be done quickly, efficiently and rigourously, entirely through the use of a graphical interface. The initial set of problems that can be solved will be limited, but I see this app as a proof of concept for a more powerful problem solving interface in the future.
